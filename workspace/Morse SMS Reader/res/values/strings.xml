    <string name="about_text">This application displays messages in the order received, 
        the newest being on top. If a new message is received while the previous one is vibrating, 
        it will play only after the previous message is finished. Please note, that when application is running - your phone is in silent state, so only Morse SMS Reader can use phone\'s vibrator. Phone ringing state will become normal after closing app.\nTo convert custom text 
        to Morse Code vibration, enter it below. Also, you can use some text as 
        separator between two sequential messages.</string>
